A description of your run can go here

************** REQUIRED BLOCK ***************** ! These are the only required pieces that must be included in every RAM-SCB run (if restarting a run, replace STARTTIME with RESTART)
#STARTTIME
2013                    iYear			! Sets the year, month, day, hour, and minute for run start
3                       iMonth
17                      iDay
00                      iHour

0.0                     FracSecond

! Note that the STOP funcionality has been changed. For normal runs there is no difference, but for runs with RESTART the amount of simulation time in tSimulationMax will be added on to instead of kept static.
#STOP
-1                      MaxIteration		! Once RAM has completed this many iterations the code will stop, -1 turns this off. (Note, because RAM time steps are variable by default the amount of time this will run is variable)
900                     tSimulationMax		! Total amount of simulation time to run RAM for, -1 turns this off. You must have one of these set to a non-negative value, or use the STOPTIME command

#STOPTIME
2013                    iYear                   ! Sets the year, month, day, hour, and minute for run stop
