<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Parameter Editor Help</H1>

The parameter editor is a graphical user interface (GUI) that helps editing
parameter files of scientific codes. It behaves like a normal editor: one can
open a new file or an existing file (the name is arbitrary, but we will use
the name PARAMFILE in this manual). When an existing file is opened, the
original file is copied into PARAMFILE~ (similarly to the emacs editor). 
If the editor is exited or a new file is opened without saving the edited file,
then the last state of the file is saved into PARAMFILE.bak.

The GUI consists of three frames: 
<ul>
<li><A HREF=#TOPFRAME>top frame</A> with various <A HREF=#BUTTONS>buttons</A>
   and <A HREF=#SELECTMENUS>select menus</A>,
<li><A HREF=#LEFTFRAME>left frame</A> showing the parameter file,
<li><A HREF=#RIGHTFRAME>right frame</A> 
   showing extra information, such as manuals, clipboard,
   files to be inserted, or list of errors.
</ul>
The parameter editor GUI can be 
<A HREF=#CUSTOMIZE>customized with the configuration file ParamEditor.conf</A>.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME=TOPFRAME>Top Frame</A></H2>

By default the top frame shows the name of the edited parameter file 
in the middle and the <A NAME=BUTTONS>following buttons:</A>
<ul>
<li><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE=CHECK>: check the parameter file for errors. 
        First all previous errors (if any) are removed from the left frame.
        Next a list of errors will be displayed in the right frame,
        as well as where they occur in the left frame.

<li><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE=SAVE>: save the edited parameter file. 

<li><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE="SAVE AS">: 
       save the edited parameter file under a different name.
       The new name will be entered into a text box in the top frame.

<li><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE=REOPEN>: re-read the input file. 
   Changes after the last save will be lost except for a 
   safety save of the current content into PARAMFILE.bak

<li><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE=OPEN>: 
   open another input file. Changes after the last save will 
   be lost except for a safety save of the current content into PARAMFILE.bak

<li><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE="DELETE CLIPBOARD">:
   delete the content of the clipboard so that it is not saved into the 
   parameter file after the #END command.

<li><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE="SAVE AND EXIT">:
   save file and exit from the editor.

<li><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE=EXIT>: 
   exit from the editor. Changes after the last save will 
   be lost except for a safety save of the current content into PARAMFILE.bak

<li><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE=HELP>: show this help message.
</ul>
    <A NAME=SELECTMENUS>The following menus and options are shown</A>:
<ul>
<li><b>View</b>: The view menu determines how the parameter file is
                 displayed in the left frame, and it also determines what
                 and where can be inserted from the insert menu.
<ul>
<li>ALL: show everything. 
<li>ALL ITEMS: show everything but all command/comments are minimized.
<li>ALL SECTIONS: show all sessions with minimized sections.
<li>ALL SESSIONS: show all sessions in minimized format.
<li>Session X: show session X maximized, others minimized.
<li>Session X/Y: show section Y from session X maximized, all others minimized.
</ul>

If any of the ALL* options is selected then full sessions can be inserted only.
If a session is selected then sections can be inserted into any session. 
If a section is selected then comments and commands can be inserted into any
of the sections of the selected type.
<p>
<li><b>Insert</b>: Inserting an object into the parameter file consist of 
up to four steps: select the appropriate view from the view menu, 
select an object from the insert menu, select a file in case a file is
to be inserted, and finally insert the object
by clicking on any of the insert buttons
<IMG SRC=button_insert.gif> in the left frame.
<p>
The content of the insert list depends on the view list. 
When the view list is set to one of the ALL* options, the insert list contains 
NEW&nbsp;SESSION, FILE and PASTE&nbsp;SESSION 
if the clipboard contains a session.
It the view list is set to a session, the insert list contains FILE, 
Section CON, sections for all components with a non-empty version,
and PASTE SECTION if the clipboard contains a section. Finally, when the
view list is set to a section, the insert list contains FILE, COMMENT, 
all the commands appropriate for the selected section, and 
PASTE&nbsp;COMMAND/COMMENT 
in case the clipboard contains a comment or a command.
The commands are either listed by groups (as determined by the command groups
in the PARAM.XML file) or alphabetically. The choice can be made by clicking
on the check box <INPUT TYPE=CHECKBOX CHECKED>abc.

</ul>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME=LEFTFRAME>Left Frame</A></H2>

The left frame shows the parameter file. Most of the functionality is
shown if the mouse if hovering over any link or button. 

The parameter file consists of one or more sessions. 
The sessions are numbered from 1 to the number of sessions, 
but they can also be named descriptively. Click on the blue
session marker to input the session name, or click on the session name
to modify it.

The code first runs with the parameters of the first
session, then upon completion it continues with the parameter modifications
of the second session, etc. A session consists of one or more sections. 
A section contains input parameters for the control module (CON), or one 
of the components (e.g. IE or GM) allowed by the current configuration 
of the framework. Each session contains one or more items. 
An item can be one of the following:
<ul>
<li><b>#COMMAND</b>: text that starts with '#' but not '#USERINPUT' followed
                  by zero or more non-empty lines containing the parameters
                  of the command. 
<li><b>#USERINPUT segment</b>: text that starts with '#USERINPUT(BEGIN)'
                             and ends with '#USERINPUT(END)'.
<li><b>ERROR</b>: text starting with the string 'ERROR' or 'WARNING'.
<li><b>COMMENT</b>: any other text
</ul>
All items (except for errors) can be edited by clicking on 
the first line of the item. 
The edited item opens a text area that can be modified and 
saved with the SAVE button. 
<p>
The sessions, sections and items can be manipulated with the following
buttons:
<ul>
<li><IMG SRC=button_remove.gif>: remove object. The removed
    object is moved to the clipboard in the right frame
    and the insert list is set to the PASTE option.
<li><IMG SRC=button_copy.gif>: copy object (except for errors). 
    The object is copied to the clipboard in the right frame
    and the insert list is set to the PASTE option.
<li><IMG SRC=button_insert.gif>: insert object defined in the
    insert menu. If the selected option in the insert menu is FILE, or PASTE
    or a command, then the object to be inserted is shown in the right frame.
<li><IMG SRC=button_minimize.gif> or 
    <IMG SRC=button_minimize_up.gif>&nbsp;: minimize object
    (except for errors or objects consisting of a single line) 
    to a single line. The <IMG SRC=button_minimize_up.gif>
    button is placed to the last line of sessions, sections and user-input
    segments.
<li><IMG SRC=button_maximize.gif>&nbsp;: maximize object, 
    ie. show all lines of the object.
</ul>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME=RIGHTFRAME>Right Frame</A></H2>

The right frame contains one of the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Manual</b>: description of a command to be inserted or edited.
<li><b>File</b>: the content of a file that can be inserted.
<li><b>Clipboard</b>: a removed or copied object than can be pasted.
<li><b>Errors</b>: list of errors produced by the 
       <INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE=CHECK> button.
</ul>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME=CUSTOMIZE>Customization with ParamEditor.conf</A></H2>

The GUI as well as the micro web-server running the GUI can be customized 
by creating a ParamEditor.conf file in the user's home directory.

When the GUI is started with the share/Scripts/ParamEditor.pl script, the
script starts a micro web-server and reads the ParamEditor.conf file for
configuration settings. One can set the default browser and/or
the default name of the edited parameter file. For example
<pre>
$browser   = "/opt/kde3/bin/konqueror";
$paramfile = "run_test/PARAM.in";
</pre>
Note that the default browser cannot be set under Mac OSX. 
For more detail type
<pre>
share/Scripts/ParamEditor.pl -h
</pre>
The GUI itself can be customized by setting variables in the 
ParamEditor.conf file. Type
<pre>
grep '^our' share/Scripts/ParamConvert.pl
</pre>
to see the variables that can be modified.
Currently the following variables can be modified:
<pre>
$RedoFrames       = 0         ; # rewrite index.php (jump.html)
$DoSafariJumpFix  = 0         ; # work around the Safari bug
$FrameHeights     ='15%,85%'  ; # heights of top frame and lower frames
$FrameWidths      ='60%,40%'  ; # widths of the left and right frames
$TopBgColor       ='#DDDDDD'  ; # background color for the top frame
$TopFileNameFont  ='COLOR=RED'; # font used for file name in top frame
$FileNameEditorWidth = 40     ; # width (chars) of filename input box
$TopTableWidth    ='100%'     ; # width of stuff above the line in top frame
$TopLine          ='&lt;HR&gt;'     ; # separator line in top frame
$RightBgColor     ='WHITE'    ; # background color for the right side frame
$LeftTableWidth   ='100%'     ; # width of table in left frame
$LeftColumn1Width =  30       ; # width of minimize/maximize button column
$LeftColumn2Width = 380       ; # width of column with command parameters
$LeftBgColor      ='#DDDDDD'  ; # background color for the left side frame
$SessionBgColor   ='#CCCCCC'  ; # background color for session markers
$SessionLine ='&lt;HR COLOR=BLACK NOSHADE SIZE=4&gt;';  # session separator line
$SessionEditorSize = 30       ; # size (characters) for session name input
$SectionBgColor   ='#CCCCCC'  ; # background color for section markers
$SectionLine ='&lt;HR COLOR=GREY NOSHADE SIZE=2&gt;';  # section separator line
$SectionColumn1Width = 8      ; # The space before the section marker
$ItemEditorBgColor='#BBEEFF'  ; # background color command/comment editor
$ItemEditorWidth  = 60        ; # width (chars) for command/comment editor
$CommandBgColor   ='#CCCCCC'  ; # background color for commands
$ParameterBgColor ='#CCCCCC'  ; # background color for command parameters
$CommentBgColor   ='#DDDDDD'  ; # background color for comments
$ErrorBgColor     ='RED'      ; # background color for errors
$UserInputBgColor ='#CCCCCC'  ; # background color for user input commands
</pre>
Note the use of dollar signs at the beginning
of the variables, the quotation marks around string values and the
semicolons at the end of lines. The comments starting with # are optional.
The customization file has to have correct Perl language syntax to work 
properly.
<p>
Other then changing colors and width of table columns, 
the configuration file can be used to work around a bug in the Safari
browser. The bug causes the browser to jump to the wrong place in the
left frame. Set
<pre>
$DoSafariJumpFix = 1; # work around the Safari bug
</pre>
in the configuration file to activate the work-around: first the
browser jumps to a jump.html file that has a JavaScript that 
directs it to the proper part of the param.html file. As a result
there is a little bit of blinking in the left frame, but still better
than not seeing the selected items and scrolling all the time.
<p>
One can also change the proportions of the three frames by e.g. setting
the variables
<pre>
$FrameHeights = '18%,82%';   # heights of top frame and lower frames
$FrameWidths  = '50%,50%';   # widths of the left and right frames
</pre>
to diffferent values. Note that the sum should be 100% in both cases.
<p>
If the frame sizes or the Safari jump fix is modified in the configuration
file while the editor, set
<pre>
$RedoFrames = 1;             # rewrite index.php (jump.html)
</pre>
so that the changes take effect without restarting the editor. 
Note, however, that this setting should be removed from the 
configuration file once the settings are permanent.
