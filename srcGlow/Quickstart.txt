Quick start for GLOW v. 0.982

Copy all the files and sub-directories into a directory, or, 
  copy the file glowv0.982.tar to a directory and tar -xf glowv0.982.tar
While in that directory:
  cp Makefile.glowbasic Makefile
    (or, cp Makefile.glowbasic.gfort Makefile if using GNU gfortran)
  gmake
Run the glowbasic driver with default dayglow inputs:
  glow.exe < in.basic.day > test.basic.day
Compare the output you get to the example output in out.basic.day
If it looks reasonable, try making some plots
Now try the glowbasic driver with default auroral inputs:
  glow.exe < in.basic.aur > test.basic.aur
Compare the output you get to the example output in out.basic.aur
If it looks reasonable, try making some plots
Then, do some runs with your own input parameters

Now try making some modifications to the glowbasic program to suit your purposes

You can also run glowbasic out of IDL using:
  spawn, './glow.exe < input.file > output.file'

Or, move on to the MPI global driver:
  Assure that MPI and netCDF libraries are installed on your operating system
  cp Makefile.glowdriver Makefile
  gmake
  cp in.namelist.msis in.namelist
  runglow.job
Check the file out.log to make sure it executed properly
Then compare the netCDF file generated to the example output at:
