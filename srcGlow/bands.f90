! Version 0.1 is really just a stub that divides total N2 singlet state
! band system excitation rate (a, a', w) into 7 upper states of the N2
! LBH band system (v' = 0-6).  States above v'=6 are presumed to dissociate.
! Frank Condon factors from Ajello and Shemansky, JGR, 90, 9845-9861, 1985

! Input:
!   Use-associated variables from cglow:
!     jmax   number of altitude levels
!     nc     number of emission components (in this case, v' levels)
!     aglw   excited state array (state, species, altitude)
!     zeta   airglow volume emission rate array (emission, species, altitude)
! Output:
!   Use-associated variables from cglow:
!     zlbh   total excitation rate to each LBH v' level (cm-3 s-1)
