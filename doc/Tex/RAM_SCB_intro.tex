The \textbf{R}ing current \textbf{A}tmosphere interactions \textbf{M}odel with 
\textbf{S}elf \textbf{C}onsistent magnetic field (\textbf{B}) is a unique code 
that combines a kinetic model of ring current plasma with a three dimensional 
force-balanced model of the terrestrial magnetic field.  The kinetic portion, 
RAM, solves the kinetic equation to yield the bounce-averaged distribution 
function as a function of azimuth, radial distance, energy and pitch angle 
for three ion species ($H^{+}$, $He^{+}$, and $O^{+}$) and, optionally, 
electrons.  The domain is a circle in the Solar-Magnetic (SM) equatorial plane 
with a radial span of 2 to 6.5 $R_{E}$.  It has an energy range of 
approximately 100\,$eV$ to 500\,$KeV$.  The 3-D force balanced magnetic field 
model, SCB, balances the $\textbf{J} \times \textbf{B}$ force with the 
divergence of the general pressure tensor to calculate the magnetic field 
configuration within its domain.  The domain ranges from near the Earth's 
surface, where the field is assumed dipolar, to the shell created by field 
lines passing through the SM equatorial plane at a radial distance of 6.5 
$R_{E}$.  The two codes work in tandem, with RAM providing anisotropic pressure
to SCB and SCB returning the self-consistent magnetic field through which RAM 
plasma is advected.

RAM-SCB has grown from a research-grade code with limited options and static 
magnetic field (RAM) to a rich, highly configurable research and operations 
tool with a multitude of new physics and output products.  This manual provides
a guide to users who want to learn how to install, configure, and execute 
RAM-SCB simulations.  While the code is designed to make these steps as
straight-forward as possible, it is strongly recommended that users review
the publications listed in the Bibliography to ensure a thorough understanding 
of the physics included in the model.  Additionally, all users are asked to 
review the terms of use.

\section{About This Manual}
Users who want to install and begin quickly should start at Chapter 
\ref{chp:quick}, which quickly outlines the path from installation to 
simulation with little detail.  The installation process is discussed fully 
in Chapter \ref{chp:install}.  Instructions on performing simulations, 
as well as several example simulations, are given in Chapter \ref{chp:run}. 
 An outline of using this code in the Space Weather Modeling Framework is 
found in Chapter \ref{chp:swmf}. Useful scripts included in the distribution
are described, in brief, in Chapter \ref{chp:scripts}.
Finally, a complete list of all param file commands is found in Chapter \ref{chp:param}.
